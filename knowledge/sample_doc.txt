2. Message History: Full conversation history with context
3. Tool Calling: The agent can search and read knowledge base files
4. Real-time Updates: SSE notifications for chat events

- GET /api/v1/chats/{id}/events - Subscribe to SSE events

Example Usage
-------------
1. Create a new chat session
2. Send a message asking about the knowledge base
3. The agent will use tools to search and read relevant documents
4. Receive an AI-generated response based on the knowledge base
