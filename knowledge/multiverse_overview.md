# The Nexus Multiverse - Overview

The Nexus Multiverse is an infinite collection of parallel realities connected through dimensional gateways called **Nexus Points**. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the multiverse structure.

## Core Concepts

### The Prime Reality (Universe-0)
Universe-0 is the original reality from which all others branched. It serves as the central hub for interdimensional travel and is governed by the **Council of Architects**.

### Dimensional Layers
The multiverse is organized into layers:
- **Layer Alpha**: Primary realities (Universes 1-1000)
- **Layer Beta**: Secondary branches (Universes 1001-100000)
- **Layer Gamma**: Infinite probability spaces
- **The Void**: The space between realities

## The Five Pillars

Five fundamental forces maintain multiverse stability:

1. **Chronos** - The flow of time across realities
2. **Aether** - The energy connecting dimensions
3. **Entropy** - The natural decay that prevents stagnation
4. **Harmony** - The balance between creation and destruction
5. **Memory** - The collective consciousness of all beings

## Key Statistics

- Total catalogued universes: 847,293,001
- Active Nexus Points: 12,847
- Registered dimensional travelers: 3,421
- Known threats: 7 (classified)

## Important Warning

Unauthorized interdimensional travel is prohibited. Violators face temporal imprisonment in the Void.
